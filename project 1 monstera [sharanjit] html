        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Sharanjit Kaur. I recently graduated from high school with a focus in commerce, and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce (Honors) at Pondicherry University. Originally from the vibrant city of Hoshiarpur in Punjab, I now call the beautiful city of Pondicherry my home.</p>
        <p>At 18, I bring a fresh and dynamic perspective to everything I do. My passion for hosting has led me to become an excellent event host, with experience in organizing and leading conferences. Whether it's a formal gathering or a lively event, I pride myself on creating an engaging and memorable experience for all attendees.</p>
        <p>In addition to my hosting skills, I am also a very talented artist. I have a knack for creating stunning portraits, capturing natural scenery, and producing live drawings and paintings. Art has always been a significant part of my life, and I love expressing myself through various mediums. My work ranges from detailed pencil sketches to vibrant watercolor landscapes, and I constantly seek to improve my craft.</p>
        <p>I am also an avid learner and enjoy exploring new subjects and skills. I am particularly interested in business and economics, which aligns perfectly with my academic pursuits in commerce. I believe in the power of continuous learning and strive to stay updated with the latest trends and developments in my field.</p>
        <p>Living in Pondicherry has been a wonderful journey, blending my roots in Punjab with the diverse and enriching culture here. I'm always excited to take on new challenges and continue growing both personally and professionally.</p>
